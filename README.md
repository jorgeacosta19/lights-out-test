About the App

Lights Out is a puzzle game consisting of an n x n grid of lights. At the beginning of the game, some of the lights are switched on. When a light is pressed, this light and the four adjacent lights are toggled,
i.e., they are switched on if they were off, and switched off otherwise. The purpose of the game is to
switch all the lights off.

Important: Even though the logic for the adjacent lights was established through the console, it has not been applied with the states for each light within the React environment.
